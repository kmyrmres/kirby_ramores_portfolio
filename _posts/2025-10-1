Hello! This is my first blog post. To start off the portfolio, I'd like to outline some of the experiences I plan to cover in my portfolio: 

1. My previous research experiences at UConn's Pathbiology, Plant Science, and Civil Engineering departments
2. My personal projects both related and unrelated to Physics
3. The skills I've learned throughout my coursework and career

Coming in the near future!
