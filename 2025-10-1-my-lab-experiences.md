Throughout my time here at UConn, I have had the pleasure of working as a laboratory & field research asssistant at three different laboratories across three different departments. In this post, I will outline the research & projects I aided to complete.

**1. Stickleback Stock Center**

   Under UConn's Pathobiology Department, the Stickleback Stock center is the premier source for research threespine Stickleback fish populations. Stickleback populations in the U.S. are unique in their genetic diversity and that distinct populations from Alaska and the Midwest are genetically similar, but live in marine and freshwater environments respectively. As such, they are used for a wide variety of research, especially in modelling the evolution from marine to freshwater environments. We supplied Stickleback from both environments and provided services such as cross breeding and gene editing to suit client needs.

   At this laboratory, I assisted in nurturing fish eggs and tracking their maturation, and I was responsible for ensuring that matured specimen were fed and underwent health inspections. I also was responsible for mechanical upkeep of aquatic systems, which included adjusting pressure valves, adjusting conductivity inputs, changing filters, and pH adjustments.


**2. Agricultural Biotechnology Building, UConn Plant Science Department**

   As part of Dr. Rosa Raudales' Laboratory, I assisted in designing and carrying out a research project pertaining to the simultaneous growth of Lettuce rex and algae in its root water supply. The ultimate objective was to observe the relationship, if any, between algal growth, the growth of Lettuce rex, and iron and phosphorous concentrations available to them.

  The first few weeks involved heavy planning and preparation to configure the greenhouse set up and sprout the lettuce seeds. I was also responsible for investigating parameters for algal growth, such as optimal pH, iron and phosophorous concentrations, and light levels. I presented my findings to the PI, and collaborating with other assistants as well as a graduate student, we helped design and implement the experiment. 

  Throughout the experiment, my main responsibilities lied in maintaining the growth beds and control/independent variables of the experiment, including pH, conductivity, and iron/phosphorous concentrations. To do this, other student workers and I prepared pH, salinity, and fertilizer solutions through calculation and combination.

  Additionally, I was responsible for implementing an automated irrigation system for a separate project. I used sensors, solenoid valves, and a Raspberry PI board programmed with Arduino code I implemented. 


**3. Connecticut Advanced Pavement Laboratory**  

  Part of a materials division in the Connecticut Transportation Institute, the CAP Lab focuses on creating and testing the properties of transportation materials, such as hot-mix asphalt materials and concrete. My primary responsibilities include carrying out tests and calculations to determine the tensile strength, bulk specific gravity,
thermal shock resistance, air void content, and other properties of asphalt samples. 
  These samples would come from either clients or internally from the lab. I have also helped create these samples for experimentation, based off of ratios of aggregate and binder that come from our internal experimental needs or that of industry clients. I have also had the pleasure of extracting samples of asphalt and concrete from a wide variety of sources in the field, including building foundations, sidewalks, and highway roads.
