author : Kirby Ramores
description : Welcome to my professional portfolio! I am currently a third year Physics major with a general concentration. With a wide range of research experience from several departments, I would love to pivot to my personal research interests, such as the modelling of complex biomolecular structures through a rigorous physical and computational approach.
